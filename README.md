# Hotel-Reservation-Prediction-System
This project focuses on predicting hotel reservation cancellations using various machine learning models and deploying the best-performing model using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. The system aims to enhance hotel operations by providing accurate predictions, which can help in better resource management and improving customer satisfaction. Additionally, a chatbot is developed to assist users in booking rooms and retrieving information, making the system more interactive and user-friendly.

# Key Features:
1- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees for predicting reservation cancellations.
2- Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
3- Azure Deployment: Deployment of the best-performing model (VotingEnsemble) using Microsoft Azure ML Studio.
4- Chatbot Integration: Development of a chatbot to facilitate room bookings and provide information, enhancing user interaction.
5- MLflow Integration: Use of MLflow for tracking experiments, managing code, and ensuring reproducibility.
